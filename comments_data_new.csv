"Copyrights belong first to the person who creates a thing. We can then sell them, or such, to another, sure, but that initial right belongs to the creator.<br/><br/>A machine has no ownership rights, how can it choose to transfer them to anyone else? How can we allow people to gain copyrights for things they did not create without the consent of the creator?<br/><br/>I can&#39;t copyright a flower. I put in work for it to grow, maybe, butI didn&#39;t create it directly. What has the right to sell me the copyrights to the flower? Nothing, so I can&#39;t have that. That is not what copyright is for.<br/><br/>There are ways in which copyrights are already too easily abused. Allowing copyright on AI generated works makes those existing abuses worse.<br/><br/>I can see an argument that code can be copyrighted - butby that reasoning, all art created with software belongs to the owners of the codebase. We already know that the maker of a tool does not then own everything made with that tool.<br/><br/>So the question becomes, how do we draw lines between the use of a tool, and automation? To say nothing of the training data sources under copyright! What is influence, what is fair use, and what is plagiarism?<br/><br/>How is a person to prove they put in the work?<br/><br/>And most immediately, how are workers to be compensated fairly if their work can simply be stolen by an AI which cannot itself be held accountable? <br/><br/>",[],"Comment from Cooke, Angela",2023-10-31T04:00:00Z
"Hello, I am a freelance artist and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. Because the current state of AI tools unethically trains their datasets on already existing copyrighted works, users of the tools claim that what they make is theirs even though they didn&#39;t create the original works that it&#39;s trained on. Considering that they can churn out hundreds of works per day, they are also threatening to take away the livelihoods of independent artists, freelance artists, voice over actors, and more for little to no pay and will cause many creative professionals to live an unsustainable life in an already unsustainable economy.

I am ABSOLUTELY opposed to Ai being allowed to grow and be used in an unregulated fashion. Not only is it at the moment being trained on the copy-written work of humans it is a clear and present danger to humanity as a whole as well as a functioning economy and society. I believe the government should HEAVILY regulate it. The European Union has already taken steps abs measures to begin regulating it and so should we. And we cannot expect it to or allow it to take the work of humans especially in the entertainment arts as it is not human and at the moment all it can do is approximate stories based on the work of others and is not capable of really touching the human spirit or soul. Many tests done with Ai with constraints removed have in VERY short time had to be taken offline because the Ai bot (probably due to the immense amount of vitriol that exists on the internet) became hostile and immediately threatened human life. If we have no way of controlling the Ai it poses a real exestentisl threat to humanity especially now that the world is so interconnected digitally.

"This is a timely and important issue to consider.  My opinion on the matter is that works coming from artificial intelligence, or generative AI, should not be copyrightable under any circumstances.<br/><br/>The use of a cognitive modeling system does not replace the essential factor of human creativity in the regulatory framework of copyrights.  Granting these systems copyright would flood the world with new copyrighted works, which would be unfair to human creators who simply could not keep up with that pace.<br/><br/>Conversely I also hold that these works, while not copyrightable, are not necessarily derivative of every image used to train the AI.  All artists, human or artificial, observe the products of other artists in the process of learning their trade.  It is how everyone learns.  In that sense all artists create derivative works. The fact that AI systems do it faster and with greater scope does not mean their works are derivative, this is a ridiculous claim.  Current copyright holders that make their works public must accept the fact that those works might be used in training.  The artist should have the option of disallowing their works&#39; inclusion in future training packages, however.<br/>",[],"Comment from Trischuk, Tim",2023-10-31T04:00:00Z

"I am a librarian and an author and I vigorously oppose so-called &quot;artificial intelligence.&quot; It is artificial, but it is not intelligent. It cannot learn, only parrot what humans have created with a gloss of sophistication granted by an algorithm.<br/><br/>Some people argue that because the tool is responding to a human&#39;s input, there is enough human activity and involvement to justify a copyright. I disagree. In my role as a librarian, if I craft a tightly-worded keyword search and put it into a database, that does not mean I have any intellectual property rights over the material I find. I see such prompts as far more akin to a database search than a creative act. <br/><br/>And what is this database? It is a trove created by theft of creative work by technologists who don&#39;t know how to create something that moves people, but only know how to exploit technology and other people&#39;s creative output. Consider the large amount of copyrighted material that these Large Language Models have already ingested without compensation, permission, or even the knowledge of the copyright holder. This sort of &quot;ask forgiveness rather than permission&quot; activity is underhanded and should not be permitted to go forward, let alone rewarded. The companies creating these repositories have the resources to create an opt-in process, and should be expected to do so.<br/><br/>The Constitutional purpose of copyright is &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts.&quot; This does not promote the arts, useful or otherwise and it arguably can set science back, given the way it has already become a vector not just for the dissemination but the creation of disinformation. In my job as a librarian, I have experimented with ChatGPT and found that it is as likely to misinform as it is to inform. However, all too many people are not information literate and will see such a tool as authoritative. <br/><br/>In short, I entirely oppose the granting of copyright to users of AI tools and encourage the Copyright Office to look into restricting&mdash;or better yet, banning&mdash;the wholesale, uncompensated use of copyrighted material to &ldquo;train&rdquo; such tools.<br/>",[],"Comment from Smith, Jill",2023-10-31T04:00:00Z
"Generative AI is an attack on copyright as a concept and fundamentally undermines the rights of authors, artists and creatives everywhere. But more than that, it&#39;s a massive risk of security that there is no equivalent to in history. Some people have compared the anti-ai position to Luddism, that we&#39;re simply afraid of new technology, but what we&#39;re afraid of is the exploitation and replacement of human skilled labour for the profit of others. On the artist front some have compared the advent of Generative AI to the invention of the camera, but the camera cannot spread anything but the truth. You have to go to a location, line up the shot with the appropriate lighting, composition, lens and whatever photo you take will be exactly what was there, no more, no less. The scale of these models cannot be ignored, for every one person who has the skills to photoshop convincing misleading images such as political propaganda or digitally removing clothes from women, there exists an ai model that can spit out thousands of images in a fraction of the time, most unconvincing and garbled but every now and then there is an image that can fool people. We are on the precipice of an age of immense misinformation with automated news articles from chatgpt hallucinating stories and events that never happened, photos that were never taken that might be used as blackmail, and worse still the harvesting of one&#39;s own voice that it might ruin careers with words that were never said, and scam family members out of money across the phone because they believed you were in danger. <br/><br/>Please read through every comment carefully, as it&#39;s very likely that this form will be filled out by bad actors using LLMs like chat gpt to make it seem like the majority doesn&#39;t care about copyright protection. Without copyright there is no reason to create, to share, to innovate if another can steal your work at a moment&#39;s notice and run it through a filter to claim it as their own through functions like image to image. The pressure from billion dollar tech companies to make this legal loophole a legitimate business model will be immense, but the repercussions on society as a whole can already be seen with people losing jobs to ai, misinformation through ai generated images, and the violations the datasets have already committed scraping from the internet indiscriminately such as the inclusion of images of children and private medical records in LAION5B cannot be ignored for a short term profit.

"Hi,I am an independent artist, programmer and creative very concerned with the current state of Gen-AI and what the future holds for artists and creatives.<br/><br/>I would like to focus my comment on image generators and the art field, but I know there is similar disruptions all over the field, including actors, voice-actors and photographers.<br/><br/>I believe that the in the current sate, image gen-AI (eg. StableDiffusion, Midjourney etc.) are very much abused and are very much copyright violations. They are very damaging to the creative industries as a whole, is unethical, and have already shown misuse both by the developers of those software and by the users on the internet.<br/><br/>While the technologies that these Gen-AI(s) uses are not inherently evil or unethical, the current implementations of these softwares require scrapings of copyrighted information on the internet fed into it&#39;s libraries to function and give any desirable output. <br/><br/>If you go to haveibeentrained.com, and search the names of any famous artist, or reverse search image of any artwork, you would definitely see a lot of scraped and copyrighted images there. These images were trained by any AI trained with the LAION-5B(5 billion) dataset, and is the core of gen-AI products like StableDiffusion and Midjourney.(See attached)<br/><br/>Essentially, these AI companies are using the data stole from the artists and photographers for free, to make a product that distrubutes said data for profit. It forces the creatives to compete with themselves while the companies makes all the profit. Artists are rarely, if not at all compensated for the data that was non-consensually scraped.<br/><br/>None of this process really has any human level intelligence behind them, as these programs are not an actual intelligence, but lossy compression algorithms with input and output. It&#39;s more of a content remixing machine. The associaltion with AI is purely marketing &quot;hype&quot;.<br/><br/>And there has been some very disturbing misuses of these generators too. Including impersonation, scams, potential defimations. But some most extreme cases include making incredibly realistic pornography of children, hate speech etc.<br/><br/>The Times article: The Case Against AI Everything, Everywhere, All at Once (https://time.com/6302761/ai-risks-autonomy/) Has some great points about the behaviors of these companies and the dangers these technologies can pose, be it social, economical or environmental.<br/><br/>Thus, while I agree that AI could have real uses, I believe that the these current practices of these companies must not be allowed and must be regulated. <br/><br/>We should stand by humans and not hurt the beautiful communities  and industries we already have for a dangerous, unethical system that requires exploitation to work.<br/><br/>And this is why I urge the US to take actions on these companies and lead the world in regulations in this field, allow creatives who care about their work and their impact thrive, ensuring the companies are held accountable when it comes to the contents it can generate and the sources of those data be ethically sourced.<br/><br/>",[],Comment from Anonymous,2023-10-31T04:00:00Z
"See attached file(s)<br/><br/>To allow AI to use creative pieces/man-made pieces without explicit permission from the author(s), is inherently unethical, and in many cases, illegal.  There is no ethical version of AI unconsensually using the authors&#39; creative content- especially not for any type of income or commercial purpose.  It is infringement of the creator&#39;s rights, to use without knowing explicit permission from the authors.<br/><br/>The constitutional justification for this blatant copyright is to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts.&quot;<br/><br/>Not only does the practice discourage artists, but promotes the unethical practices of taking a targeted artist&#39;s work and copying directly off of them in a technological format, without a human touch and human effort behind the piece itself.  A person may choose to study artworks themselves, and create pieces based off of their learned works- but this, as long as it is done in honest will, will result in a type of style unique to each person, and an effort ethically able to gain money from.  The AI is being used to harass creators and use their works for profit, with no human effort or touch behind the technological process.  It is living off the backs of people that work hard to develop skills, earned typically over years of labor, without their permission or compensation.<br/><br/>Sites that have tried to protect artists and writers from AI copyright are still preyed upon- more often than not, for profit only.  Merge a few artworks (without the creators permission), paste, get money- all it takes are a few clicks.  In no way is this an ethical practice.  It takes revenue from the artist&#39;s hard-earned works and skill, in a lazy, unconsensual, and frankly disgusting way.<br/><br/>&quot;The educational exceptions&quot; for the AI are being blatantly ignored by many, if not most.<br/><br/>It hurts me deeply, personally, and makes me fear posting any creative content made by my own hand.  It would feel terrible to see any part of it being used for revenue somewhere else without my permission, and discourage any hand-made creative processes further.  <br/><br/>I can see AI encouraging creative people and others as a whole, but not without respecting the authors, the hard work and talent it comes from, behind everything being generated, and firmly implementing the grounds in which it is appropriate to use such works.<br/><br/>Please implement creator/author consent to all these AI&#39;s.  As long as there is explicit and knowing consent from each individual author/creator, we can hope to not discourage the actual artists, and maintain the baseline of respect and ethics that should&#39;ve always been there, while still feeding the learning algorithms.<br/><br/>Any unconsensual generative/scraping/other AI made for/including creative works, that isn&#39;t truly being used in (or directly supporting the ethical grounds of) the good will of the original authors of works being scraped, should be firmly illegal.<br/><br/>I truly hope this can change something.",[],Comment from Anonymous,2023-11-01T04:00:00Z

"At its most basic level, copyright exists as an agreement between society and the artist. Having art is good for society. Make us art, says society, and we will let you profit solely off this art for some span of time. This is the only possible way art can survive in a capitalist society.<br/><br/>Presumably, you want to preserve a capitalist society. Therefore, you must enforce copyright. Companies must prove that they have contracts with every artist, writer, or other creative they scraped to train their bots, from the most prominent named artists to comparative unknowns who posted a single tweet. If they cannot do so in any instance, their entire imitation bot must be erased and made illegal. Only imitation bots trained on properly sourced and contracted material can operate. Furthermore, no product of imitation bots must ever be allowed to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>This may seem harsh compared to what you are currently pursuing, but the only alternatives would be to destroy all incentives to make art or dismantle capitalism.

AI voice technology is extremely damaging to both people who profit off of their voice (Voice Actors, Musicians, etc.) and people in public positions. If AI voice content becomes more normalised, companies will start leaning towards using AI voice technology over hiring voice actors. This event would cause many people to lose their jobs. AI voice has also been used to generate NSFW content of characters and people who are under the age of 18. The same issue has been prominent with AI art generation as well. <br/>AI voice has been compared to vocal synthesisers. There is one main difference that AI voice users disregard. The voicebanks and characters from vocal synthesisers are created with the voices of PAID individuals. Vocal synthesisers also do not sound identical to the voice provider, which creates a distinct barrier between the voice provider and the voicebank used in the synthesiser. The voice provider is compensated each time their voicebank is bought, sometimes as well as additional royalties. <br/>I firmly believe that AI content generation technology should not be used in most situations. There are instances where AI voice technology is used to replicate certain voices from deceased actors.

"I am a writer, hoping to get published one day and I draw as a hobby too.<br/><br/>I believe AI art is not copyright infringement.

"I cannot answer the questions given point by point, given the character limits, but I will try to state my broad concerns addressed in them:<br/><br/>1) Because AI is not sapient and cannot comprehend its input or output, none of its works can be said to be &quot;intellectual&quot; property. While the models are impressive and often put out results that are comprehensible to humans, the machine does not understand or care about what it has produced.<br/><br/>2) The humans running the machine did not produce the work, either, even if they did write the prompt; even if they carefully honed the prompt over time. I have commissioned human artists for artwork before; while I then own the right to use it for personal purposes, the copyright for that piece remains theirs unless I specifically buy it from them. The artist did the labor; I just laid out the specifics. *I* am not the artist of that piece; I am a client, even if I buy my way into being a copyright holder. It seems wildly unprecedented to me for a human to claim authorship of a commissioned piece, just because the &quot;artist&quot; was a machine instead of a human.<br/><br/>3) All major AI models have been trained on art and writing for which it did not receive authorial permission. AI does not cite its sources, and even the creators of the models cannot track where the machine did its learning, or precisely how it compiled its output. And since it is not actually intelligent, the AI cannot make decisions or be held accountable for what kind of things it learns, or who to credit for them. Until this is resolved, current models seem to me to be fundamentally unethical--the model consumes work it does not own, benefiting from the labor of creators who will never see a dime from the AI&#39;s profits.<br/><br/>4) There may, in the future, be an ethical way to produce AI-generated writing, as the models gain a more advanced command of the rules of English. Words have limited meanings, and no one person can copyright basic parts of speech. I believe this would only be limited to more technical writing--there are only so many ways, for instance, to describe how to operate a toaster. A dozen human writers working independently would all produce similar-sounding work, without plagiarizing at all. Perhaps AI can one day be considered equal to such a task. I do not think AI is there yet, with so many unresolved issues surrounding its sources.<br/><br/>5) I do not see any way that there will ever be ethically-produced AI-generated art--especially graphic and visual art, but also music, poetry, etc. While *words* are largely static and for use by all, *art* is innately personal to the artist. Their handwriting, their brushstrokes, the way they see and abstract and represent their observations; their conventions, their stylistic markers, etc. AI cannot innovate. It cannot imagine. It cannot experiment. It cannot interpret. It has no lived experience. It can only acquire, and systematize, and repurpose. AI generated art of all forms is innately derivative, with no way to make it otherwise. While all artists must take inspiration from others, AI cannot be inspired; it can merely copy. I cannot see a way it will ever *not* infringe upon human authorial rights; I cannot see a way it can ever produce any art that should be considered original or copyrightable.<br/><br/>6) I believe AI should be regulated to only harvest data from those who opt-in with specific permission. In other words, existing email, cloud storage, social media sites, etc., should not be allowed to simply insert a clause into their TOS to allow themselves to train their machines on their users. Such methods are easily missed by users, and it essentially holds them under duress to pressure their consent.<br/><br/>7) I believe AI should be regulated so that any services run by image or language generators should clearly and plainly disclose themselves as such. i.e., Tech support chat bots, automated tellers, etc. It is my belief that people should never be duped into thinking they are interacting with a human if they aren&#39;t.<br/><br/>8) I believe that, going forward, if there *are* AI-generated works that allow a human to hold copyright and financially benefit from them, that human *must* also be held accountable for what the AI creates. This includes plagiarism, illegal / incendiary output, being trained on non-permitted sources, etc. Humans should should not gain benefits from owning/using an AI to create *unless* they are liable for its output, as well.",[],"Comment from Beattie, Amanda",2023-10-31T04:00:00Z

"AI image generators is what I have the most experience with; unlike in a regular search engine, an AI image generator removes the owner of art, and combines pre-existing art with other pre-existing art - always without crediting its original creators. The end result is a collage that lacks imagination, originality, and any kind of creative skills. It is stealing labour from artists, who already struggle to be paid fairly in a capitalist system that devalues the existence and significance of arrt, whilst still constantly using it, and taking advantage of its creators. The lack of protection that regular artists struggle with is only going to get worse the more pervasive generative AIs become, and without regulation, it will be impossible to have ownership over work you have created.",[],"Comment from Olorenshaw, Molly",2023-10-31T04:00:00Z
"I believe that companies developing generative AI technology should have to acquire written consent from every person whose work they use to train their models, requiring opt-in, not opt-out. The burden should be on those who seek to profit from other people&rsquo;s work to gain permission from those people; ordinary citizens should not be burdened with the responsibility of seeking out every single corporation who might want to exploit their work. I understand that large sample sizes are crucial for training these neural networks, but those sample sizes should be sourced ethically, and that means informed consent. <br/><br/>Individuals should not be allowed to copyright work generated by these algorithms. If profit is generated from AI, it should be distributed among everyone whose work went into the creation of the neural network, including people whose data was used to train said network. Tech companies should have to keep detailed registers of where they sourced their data, who the original author was, when the data was sourced, and how it was acquired. There should be a governmental standard for records of provenance, and there should be penalties for noncompliance. <br/><br/>Tech companies must do everything in their power to make the utilization of AI identifiable: requiring licenses for use, retaining records of who used the technology and when. Most importantly, if AI technology is abused in any way, the creator of the neural network should be held liable for damages. Hopefully, this will incentivize better record-keeping, and a more mindful attitude about the harm that neural networks can cause in the wrong hands.",[],"Comment from Cohen, Emi",2023-10-31T04:00:00Z

"Artificial intelligence, in its current form, is largely trained on stolen media from various sites and creators, with blatant disregard for permission to use the stolen media.  Many artists, writers, and other creators do not grant permission to use their works to train algorithms, and those in support of artificial intelligence view it as a way of replacing creators, despite the algorithms merely cobbling together something from existing parts taken from their original creators.  It has reached a point that creators have been forced to use external means of protecting their creations, such as visual artists utilizing the software Glaze to mask their work, which those training artificial intelligence have called &quot;poisoning&quot; the algorithms--all but admitting that they do not bother to contact the creators to use their work.<br/><br/>In its current state, artificial intelligence is little more than a Frankenstein&#39;s monster of parts stolen from other creators.  Those utilizing artificial intelligence tout their &quot;hard work&quot;, when it is little more than feeding a description and stolen content into a program that spits out a hodgepodge for them.  The true hard work is that of the creators who made the content in the first place, pouring hours upon hours into their work only for others to decide &quot;I can do that too&quot; and steal it for selfish purposes.  Artificial intelligence is a blatant mockery of media creation, and can never replace the original creators; &quot;content&quot; produced by artificial intelligence cannot be granted any form of copyright protection, as there is nothing original about it to protect.  To allow &quot;content&quot; produced by these algorithms the safety of copyright only reinforces the belief that the original creators cannot protect their work, and in time it will lead to a severe drought of original content and an upsurge of algorithmic regurgitation.",[],"Comment from Ross, Sami-Jo",2023-10-31T04:00:00Z

However, if it is, there needs to be safeguards and compensation, especially in Hollywood. Writers and actors should be able to work with AI and not be dominated by it.

Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nicole Silverberg<br/>LOS ANGELES, CA",[],"Comment from Silverberg, Nicole",2023-11-01T04:00:00Z
"See attached file(s)The following comment submitted by Bernice Yu, Esq. will discuss ways AI generated materials can be used in training, contend AI generated work created by machine is not entitled to copyright and propose a strict liability standard to measure damages for negligent use of AI generated materials be applied because data cannot be denied that foreseeable dangerous consequences may result because of failure to assume responsibility for  what is generated and released without clear digital watermarking of machine generated content.<br/><br/>The purpose of copyright law is to promote the continuous creation of work in the arts and sciences by people.  Protection of work generated by people with copyright promotes progress in society.  Throughout history this body of copyrighted work has developed in an evolutionary manner where what exists today is derivative of past work and evocative of what will come in the future.<br/><br/>The intent of copyright is to afford certain limited time monopoly like rights and protections in exchange for human contributions to the body of work.  Exclusivity cannot be granted to mere ideas alone like consulting detectives or orphan boys prevailing over challenging circumstances .  Work cannot be the subject of copyright held exclusively by one individual author alone.  Instead authorship should be encouraged so that pleasure is found in attribution as a named author just as first lessons led us to be inspired to pen a sonnet, compose a song or sketch a drawing.  Learning is our joy.<br/><br/>Copyright is governed by complex rules of interpretation and a quality of recognition and association possessed through life experience and memory often summed up as look and feel. Human analysis to determine if a character is delineated enough to be copyrighted or whether the line to substantial similarity is crossed to find infringement cannot be replicated by a machine. The threshold to reach and be eligible for copyright protection should remain high and remain a human determination. By its very nature there should be a fair exchange between author and society so that collectively we all learn from one another. <br/><br/>Therefore giving an author a right to opt out of inclusion of their work in a learning model is antithetical to the spirit of copyright. It&rsquo;s problematic to restrict the incorporation of copyrighted work in order to shield or restrict viewers so that others cannot compare, analyze, criticize or comment.  To teach students we want to examine the best examples.  Democracy means we share viewpoints.  With science we all advance by sharing discoveries  Use of works in repositories to promote creativity does not necessarily mean a worker will be eliminated.  Most copyright on scripts and screenplays are held by producers and studios not the hired writers.  In my experience the public prefers a modern fresh take on what may be evocative images or a story as old as time.  Trend setters are part of the present and call for the new.  <br/><br/>Since copyright is meant to protect works which are generated by people with the sweat of their brow let&rsquo;s agree that all machine generated work should be required to disclose its attribution like a digital watermark and is not entitled to separate copyright. This would include AI images of identifiable persons or works of art.  These works are better protected by trademark law principles of dilution, passing off, defamation and false light as well as privacy and publicity laws.<br/><br/>There is a human weakness to desire to go beyond becoming a legend in your own mind and expanding into some immortal world domination status which is at the crux of the concern.  No longer is imitation considered a form of flattery.  Rather envy and fear pervades that machines which seemingly have a capacity to learn well beyond people will eliminate the need for people.  The reality of copyrighted work is the distillation of human endeavor which encapsulates deliberate and intentional human choices.  The essence of humanity cannot be counterfeited by AI.  People are more than an algorithm shuffling collected compiled data for random output.  Also todays celebrities who apply for copyright of their AI enhanced image to control its exploitation should be rejected. We often see celebrities marketing their image in various avenues of trade which makes sense because exploitation might anticipate continuous use in trade. But copyright is for a fixed term so no grant of copyright.<br/><br/>Those who develop AI are in the best position to be powerful guardians of society inspiring a more truthful internet as we strive to build a society which seeks permission as the first step rather them pleading for forgiveness as the last resort.  Understand trends and see frightening events occur inspired by propaganda propagated to manipulate. It is time for content providers or internet platforms to be responsible and guard against negative occurrences and consequences.  Otherwise liability awaits.",[],"Comment from Yu, Bernice",2023-11-01T04:00:00Z

"When AI-generated content appears in creative works, none of said work should be copyrightable, including the non-AI parts, through an &ldquo;unclean hands&rdquo; doctrine. This may seem quite a huge step, but it simply recognises the reality that there is probably no way of knowing if the AI-components&rsquo; underlying data was originally obtained legally or illegally. This means we should ban AI from the Arts. If we do not, then the creative industries will collapse, with it the Arts and, with that, humanity itself.<br/><br/>We also need to remember the underlying purpose of copyright law, which must be to protect originality. If people cannot protect their originality, then there will be far less of it, if any, which will hamper innovation. Imagine if companies could not protect their patents or trademarks. Entire industries would fail.<br/><br/>Much of the defence of AI is that it is only a &ldquo;tool&rdquo;. I agree it is a tool, but the question is whether that tool is being used legally or illegally. A crowbar used to burgle a house is also a tool. Data law needs to be strengthened and enforced, so that data can only be used if there is a valid legal reason. &ldquo;Fair use&rdquo; and &ldquo;legitimate interest&rdquo; is not good enough and &ldquo;research purposes&rdquo; should not be abused, especially where a commercial entity sets up a research non-profit, so it can then take the data to use for commercial purposes (data laundering).<br/><br/>As I say, AI needs to be banned from the Arts completely and this needs to be written into the Berne Convention. Nothing less will protect creators, democracy or human rights.",[],"Comment from Stead, Peter",2023-11-01T04:00:00Z

"As a graphic designer and advertising copywriter with over 20 years experience in the field, I am strongly opposed to the way generative AI platforms are scraping the web and stealing/copying existing creative works. It would be wrong for an AI to read &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; and then proceed to write a new novel in the same style as Ernest Hemingway. It should be considered similarly wrong for an AI to read website copy, ads, blog articles, etc and copy them in a certain style. Anything that a creator publishes, whether graphic design, written copy, videos, animation, illustration, photography etc. should be considered protected work under copyright law. We, as artists, should be asked to &quot;opt in&quot; to &quot;training&quot; (stealing) AI software, instead of the reverse. Right now, those of us with public portfolios are risking having our work stolen or copied for the sake of AI &quot;learning&quot; how to generate images, when it fact it is mostly copying the hard work of those who came before.

"Greetings,<br/><br/>I am a professional, internationally published and licensed artist. My work has been published in multiple languages and on numerous products. This is how I make my living and pay my taxes. As such I see that allowing AI full copyright would be detrimental to the lives of countless artists across all fields. <br/><br/>Precedence has already been set in numerous companies for AI to take over jobs, a large one being customer service. Replacing people with tech is a growing industry and one that is likely to continue. Many various companies have already expressed wanting to use AI to replace the artists that they currently employ and pay, as we saw with the recent writers strike. Companies who create products and entertainment would no longer require artists to design the items, entertainment, or the art that is featured on these products because they could have a program generate images or designs. Programs that wouldn&rsquo;t exist without artists in the first place. This would be especially prevalent in the mid level sectors where the bulk of artists and designers are employed, as companies see cutting jobs and replacing people with programs as a great way to cut costs. This is already a difficult field to get into and takes years of work and practice. Despite what many think being an artist isn&rsquo;t a talent, it is a skill that needs to be nurtured and developed. Many artists are in deep debt from college loans and classes trying to improve their craft and I firmly believe that copyrights grants and ownerships are one of the few things making it possible for artists to hang onto the jobs they have as companies don&rsquo;t want to use programs that would not allow copyrights of their Intellectual Properties and designs. <br/><br/>Personally I have seen a steady drop on my sales both online and in person, and I do believe this is partly from AI. Commissions have almost completely dried up as privately people no longer need or want to hire artists to see their own visions come to life, and my social media engagement is almost non-existent because sites like instagram and Facebook are over saturated with AI content. Many of these wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by copyright but my licensing contracts would and this is one of the few places I am still earning my living. I have already heard that copyrights are one of the few things holding some of these companies accountable to continue licensing artwork from artists. <br/><br/>I have wanted to be a full time artist since the age of 8. It is the only thing I have focused my life&rsquo;s work on, and for the last several years and it has allowed me to live my life fairly comfortably. I know several artists who are in the same position. Not allowing AI copyright status truly is one of the last hopes many of us have in keeping our jobs and lifestyles. I implore you to keep the laws as they are and only grant copyrights to humans so that humans can continue to live and work.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration, <br/>Carla Morrow",[],"Comment from Morrow, Carla",2023-11-01T04:00:00Z

"I am a literary agent with strong familiarity with the technological underpinnings of LLM technology (aka &quot;AI&quot;). This technology has already created a serious burden on the short fiction market, with prestigious magazines being swamped by LLM-generated fiction, which makes it increasingly difficult for these incubators of culture to stay in business. In publishing, the current impact has primarily been on cover designers and audiobook narrators, who are being pushed out of work or seeing their income depressed. Editors are another role at risk-- it is easy for an LLM to &quot;evaluate&quot; a novel for marketability, effectively demoting editors to the role of cleaning up algorithmically-approved manuscripts, which can only weaken our deeply rooted literary culture. We are not far off from LLMs being capable of generating coherent novels, and strong regulations are warranted before we get to that point. <br/><br/>I believe that the ruling that LLM-generated work cannot be copyrighted is appropriate, and puts natural checks on the technology. However, without an effective way of knowing whether a given work is LLM-generated, that ruling is ultimately extremely limited. I believe we need a supporting regulation that makes it easy for regulators and consumers to identify how much of a work is LLM-generated.<br/><br/>Finally, all use of an author&#39;s work for training models must be by consent. &quot;Opt-out&quot; models are not acceptable, particularly when generating works that could be considered &quot;Derivative Works&quot; of the author&#39;s actual creations. There is no other circumstance in which it would be acceptable to produce and sell derivative works of non-public-domain material without consent, so LLM-generated works &quot;in the style of&quot; a known author or artist must be treated accordingly. <br/><br/>I do feel that there are appropriate uses of LLMs in the creative process, but using them to generate a finished product can only have the effect of making it impossible for ordinary Americans to pursue creative careers. While many tech entrepreneurs still subscribe to the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; ideology, it is not in the American interest for entire sectors of the economy to be broken. We need thoughtful regulations that treat LLM-generated works as less protected than human-authored works; that protect the rights of the authors, artists, and other creative people whose works are incorporated into training sets, usually without consent; and that preserve the basic structure of our existing creative industries, such that workers are able to enter them in roles other than &quot;LLM babysitter.&quot; ",[],"Comment from Banka, Lauren",2023-11-01T04:00:00Z

"Dear US Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am writing to offer my comments on the matter of Artificial Intelligence and Copyright as set forth in Docket No. 2023-18624. As an independent experimental artist, I have engaged extensively with AI tools, creating custom models trained on my own art to explore my aesthetic inclinations through these technological mediums (see included images). My intention is never to emulate or plagiarize the work of other contemporary artists but to delve into a novel artistic space. The points below reflect a holistic and progressive understanding of AI within the copyright framework:<br/><br/>1. Fair Use: The practice of training AI models and generating output from them is aptly understood within the existing fair use framework concerning copyright. This understanding encourages the development and application of AI technologies while respecting the legal boundaries set by copyright laws.<br/><br/>2. Copyright and Human Authorship: Copyright is reserved for works of human authorship. Hence, raw AI output, which lacks human intervention, should be considered outside the purview of copyright protections. However, when a de minimis transformation is imparted to AI-generated media by human actors, copyright protection should be afforded, recognizing the human creativity and expression involved.<br/><br/>3. Labor Market Concerns: The potential impact of AI on the labor market, especially concerning commercial artists, is a labor issue rather than a copyright issue. Addressing this concern through robust labor protections and organization in industries susceptible to AI displacement will foster a healthy adaptation to technological advancements.<br/><br/>4. Generative AI as a Tool: Generative AI is a tool, the use or misuse of which falls under the responsibility of the end-users. A well-structured framework that educates and governs end-user responsibility will help in mitigating potential misuses of this technology.<br/><br/>5. Personal Engagement with AI as an Artist: My experience as an artist leveraging AI tools exemplifies the potential for individual creative exploration that these technologies offer. They provide a unique avenue for artists to investigate their own aesthetic choices, extending the boundaries of what is artistically possible.<br/><br/>I believe these points contribute to a balanced and informed dialogue surrounding the interaction between AI and copyright, aiming for a resolution that honors the rights of creators, fosters innovation, and accommodates the realities of the labor market.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.

Whats the point in spending 5-10 years of my life creating or designing something special, something to give me an edge and an identity in the market, if its just going to be hoovered up by these billion dollar tech companies and spat out whole-cloth or &#39;interpolated&#39; in auto-generated work for free to their user-base without any consent or compensation from me?<br/><br/>They say &quot;your code and art doesn&#39;t exist inside the training data! It learns like a person!&quot;<br/>It does not learn like a person. It is not a person.

It doesn&#39;t take a teenager more than a summer to learn to drive, so clearly these machines are not &#39;learning like people&#39;.<br/>And even if they did, in what world, and by what logic does that make it okay to benefit off the creative/technical labor of others for monetary gain or otherwise?  I can think of no context where taking the blood, sweat, and tears of individual workers and using it against them in the market should be acceptable.<br/><br/>Its simple. Any and all data in any form belongs to the person/entity that created it. If I create data in the form of code or art, its my right, and my right alone how that data is handled or used.

It was used completely as training material at the moment of ingestion, and they did not get consent.<br/><br/>All of these companies need to have their ill-gotten systems destroyed and then they can start from scratch properly.

"I have very strong concerns about AI and its implications for creative and intellectual works. As it stands currently AI is able to replecate style and content of individuals without requiring their permission or even their knowledge. I believe without heavy regulation Artificial Intelligence has the potential to make intellectual property theft run rampant. I attatched an image comparing an AI generated image next to the painting it was replicating. This is an example of a well known painting, but when AI is used to replicate art created by lesser known artists it becomes much more difficult to discern if a piece of art was stolen or not. As a matter of fact, all AI generated images use already existing art for reference, and I believe that one could make the argument that all AI art infringes on the rights of Intellectual Property holders. <br/><br/>The solution could be a restriction on what AI is able to use as reference, requiring the developers of the AI generation program reach out to artists and writers to get permission before their program can use their art or writing as reference. Or it could be a requirement that all works created with AI must be labeled as such, and those whose art or writing was used as reference by the AI must be credited.

"Good Morning<br/>Before getting too far in creating policy that can punish/deter advancement, we need to look at things through clear lenses.  In the arena of copyright, copyright is supposed to protect the creator from someone else &#39;stealing&#39; their effort and reaping gain.  There have been many challenges to this, sometimes even misunderstandings and lawsuits have happened.<br/>In the AI arena, Deep Learning is still truly in the &#39;fill in the blank&#39;/&#39;best guess&#39; stage, just with the growing number of calculations in the smallest time interval taking place.  In a sense, going back a year, working with Generative AI for imagery involved a lot of internet &#39;scraping&#39;, but for those of us who kept trying to produce productions utilizing as much &#39;creativity/interpretation&#39; from the machine side possible, we are getting somewhere.  <br/>In producing my current project: ORDER OF THE ORCHID, it has been challenging to produce a multi character full animation since it isn&#39;t as simple as copy/paste.  At the same time, in no way have I based any of the imagery on a camera shot of someone in my neighborhood and/or on social media.  In fact, I have a few shots of my character Lex who resembles a former First Lady which I&#39;ve kept as an example to show someone who might inquire.  Otherwise, I&#39;ve attached a few shots of the more comic book version (this format doesn&#39;t allow video) where there are a lot of &#39;pages&#39; crammed on to each frame.  Episodes 1 and 2 now total over 8 minutes in video.<br/>Generative AI allows me to produce image, turn image into slight animated movement, add audio and put together a production as I did back when during my time in media.  Though some of the art may appear sloppy, that is because I&#39;m trying to stay in a neutral place gaining from the person&gt;prompt&gt;program possible and then weave together while you still work the day job.<br/>Since I come from the arena of music (Bachelor Music Performance/Classical Guitar), I do believe in the importance of copyright, yet am realistic about ramifications and reality.  There will be those who steal and the end of the line creator needs to understand that will happen.  Saying artwork produced by AI is bad will not get us anywhere and simultaneously, we need to communicate to folks that when they post/share something online, it is being disseminated into DATA of some sort.

Non-AI artist&#39;s work will be<br/>more special as it&#39;s hand made and distinguished by AI art.",[],"Comment from King, Daniel",2023-12-07T05:00:00Z

"Hello Copyright Office, I&#39;m not very good at English so I have to use google. translate And I&#39;m not a US civilian, but I&#39;ve also been affected by AI. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll include the language I use.<br/>I&#39;ve read in articles online &#39;democratize creativity&#39; that it&#39;s true that we post our drawings online, but that doesn&#39;t mean our drawings can be used to train AI for free because those drawings are earned. Copyright protection: Copyright, but current copyright law cannot criminalize Ai.<br/><br/>Meta: if copyright restricts us from letting the people produce big anime titties, then the US will fall behind on innovation...<br/>Will the United States lag behind in innovation? I&#39;ll take the popular anime (scott pilgrim takes off) as an example. This is also a human creation.<br/>This is an excuse for copyright infringement by Meta to steal other people&#39;s work.<br/><br/>Microsoft: We should be allowed to scrape and ingest as much work as we want because AI gets (inspired just like humans do)<br/>Wow (AI gets inspired just like humans do)<br/>AI doesn&#39;t have five senses like humans, and I don&#39;t know anyone who has studied billions of drawings and photos.<br/>Humans learn from watching and process it in their brains, plus imagination and things that don&#39;t actually exist.<br/>Things I&#39;ve seen + imagination<br/>AI learns from photos and drawings on the internet. Each AI task requires thousands of images to be assembled.<br/>Pictures on the internet+Drawings on the internet<br/>Because of that, AI and humans do not learn in the same way.<br/><br/>Google: yes we literally admit AI competes with and displaces human creatives in the labor market buuuuut using their work is still fair use<br/>How?<br/>Our work was stolen and used for free without even asking.<br/>Google doesn&#39;t pay even 1 dollars for their stolen work.<br/><br/>Stability AI: we&rsquo;re SO generous to let creators opt out of AI  thru the HaveIBeenTrained tool , opt out is so effective!! <br/>I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t use the tools of a thief who stole billions of photos.<br/>Stability AI:(STOP saying that&rsquo;s only 6% of 2 billion images in our dataset )<br/><br/>Midjourney: we care about original creators so little we didn&rsquo;t even remember to leave a comment let alone remember the Copyright Office exists<br/>How should I feel about this comment?<br/>Midjourney expresses this opinion while seeking to profit from our work.<br/><br/>Even though these companies are a threat to artists and copyrights, some users are threatening artists and sending messages to join the AI. And I have read about child pornography. Building on AI in Japan, I would like to have rules to regulate AI as soon as possible.

"Re: COLC-2023-0006-9044 &quot;Comment from Getty Images (US), Inc&quot; <br/><br/>&gt; &quot;[Pg5] latent diffusion models developed and licensed by Bria,5 which are trained on licensed content and are marketed as safe for commercial use.&quot;<br/><br/>That Bria used licensed content is true, but not the whole truth: the model is based on Stable Diffusion 1.5 with OpenAI&#39;s CLIP ViT-L/14 encoder, both developed with web-scraped data. Attached image 1 demonstrates that the model retains some information from protected works. Adobe and Getty&#39;s image generators are similarly based on Nvidia&#39;s Edify, also developed with a mix of data (arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01324.pdf).<br/><br/>Tuning an open-source model on licensed data, putting a filter in front, then offering legal indemnity does genuinely make for a commercially safer service, but shouldn&#39;t be mistaken for developing a model using *only* what creators opted into training. To my knowledge, the latter has not yet been achieved for any capable LLM or image diffusion model.<br/><br/>&gt; &quot;[Pg17] there is an established path available for licensing copyrighted works for use in training generative AI Models. Accordingly, the loss of license revenue from that market [...]&quot;<br/><br/>I had tried to obtain a license from Getty to develop a model that can describe the contents of photos for visually impaired users. Getty repeatedly told me that they don&#39;t license images for machine learning (as in attached image 2). If there is an established process, their sales department can&#39;t find it and there was no indication of it on their website.<br/><br/>I believe what&#39;s actually meant is that they have partnered with certain companies. This leaves no path for individuals or open-source developer groups.<br/><br/>In contrast, relevant code was remarkably easy to find; there&#39;s a strong culture of releasing free and open-source code, allowing everyone to contribute and build upon each others work. Papers documenting algorithms and experiments are also freely available. arXiv.org (Cornell University&#39;s open-access preprint repository) is *the* place for AI papers, opposed to paywalled journals.<br/><br/>&gt; &quot;[Pg18] Robot.txt[sic] is not a viable means of opt-out. Robot.txt[sic] is applied at a webserver (i.e., website) level versus the content level.&quot;<br/><br/>To clarify, robots.txt can specify certain files - &quot;website level&quot; doesn&#39;t mean on/off for an entire website at once. But it&#39;s true that metadata embedded directly into the image is more convenient for images rehosted in many places.<br/><br/>&gt; &quot;[Pg18] IPTC metadata [...] identifies the copyright owner and &ldquo;Credit&rdquo; [...] and there should be a presumption that authorization is needed, especially, but not only, if a copyright notice exists.&quot;<br/><br/>The IPTC standard defines tags for prohibiting data mining, such as DMI-PROHIBITED-AIMLTRAINING. To my understanding, it&#39;s these tags that are intended to signal that data mining is prohibited, not whether the author&#39;s details field has been filled.<br/><br/>&gt; &quot;[Pg19] 9.5. In cases where the human creator does not own the copyright-for example, because they have assigned it or because the work was made for hire- should they have a right to object to an AI model being trained on their work? [Getty&#39;s response:] We do not believe that copyright law should be expanded such that [...]&quot;<br/><br/>There&#39;s tension between this response and Getty&#39;s stance that people training models &quot;need to obtain affirmative consent&quot; to protect human creators. Is an agreement made prior to generative AI&#39;s existence really affirmative consent to training? Is it right for a company that never received affirmative consent to training from the work&#39;s creator to nonetheless go on to sell affirmative consent for that work?<br/><br/>Some companies that believe their licenses already allow such usage have offered a &#39;goodwill gesture&#39;, like X/Twitter&#39;s revenue program, to show they are voluntarily passing on some profit to creators. My cynical view is that, if creators have no leverage due to being assumed to have already given up those rights, there&#39;s little permanence to such PR moves and they do not meaningfully protect human creators in the long run.<br/><br/>&gt; &quot;[Pg21] there is no credible argument that licensing costs will inhibit innovation. The multi-billion-dollar scale of investment [...] accommodates the cost of obtaining licenses&quot;<br/><br/>This shows complete disregard for the huge amount of AI progress that is made at the level of individual researchers, open-source developer groups, academia, and smaller companies. These do not have multi-billion dollar budgets, and Getty opposes open-source models being offered any exemptions.<br/><br/>The companies that integrate an existing AI model into their site cannot do so in isolation and are usually not the ones driving progress. In an environment that benefits massively from fast iteration and low barrier of entry for contributing and trying out ideas, most of which fail, a requirement to pay large fees in advance of training is not viable and may entirely kill the US&#39;s competitive edge in the field.",[],Comment from Anonymous,2023-12-07T05:00:00Z
"I&#39;m a freelance artist and all I have seen with AI generators has been nothing but negative. Seeing artist work being used and put into an AI generator, agents their wishes and being used to compete with said artist. There is also an oversaturated market of computer generated images on social media and some in places were people look to hire or find artist. Such as Deviant art and artstation, which also have places in their sites filled with nothing but AI generated image. Also the fact that they are allowed in places where artist find work shows that they are being used to compete with artist.<br/><br/>You can also see example of artist competing with AI generated versions of their work on places like search engines. Like google or sites like pinterest, Example such Kelly McKernan on google an artist and If you look her up the first thing is a AI generated image that was made with her work. If someone were to see this they would think it was her work and possibly be convinced that whom ever posted it was her. <br/><br/>I will also Send some examples of people blatantly copying peoples work wit AI generators.<br/>Hopefully you can see how this contradicts Copyright.",[],"Comment from Dickinson, victoria",2023-12-07T05:00:00Z
"For well over a year, artists such as myself and other colleagues have been trying our best to make the public aware of the dangers of generative artificial intelligence poses to our livelihoods and the art industry as a whole. While many of us do see the potential for generative AI in the arts, we simply cannot support our decades worth of work by thousands of artists being used without permission to train AI models. While some companies have made attempts to only use public domain works and data they themselves own, such as Adobe&#39;s Firefly for one example, the most popular models such as OpenAI&#39;s DALL-E, Stability AI&#39;s Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney Inc.&#39;s Midjourney are trained using the LAOIN database. LAOIN contains over 2 billion scraped images gathered without permission by their original creators. LAOIN, StabilityAI, and OpenAI have been the focus of several lawsuits due to the use of copyrighted images without permission from their owners. Many he owners and employees are fully aware of this, as seen in the two attached images below from a recent update to an ongoing lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney. In one of these examples, an Jack Gallagher, an engineer from Midjourney, confirms in the official Discord for Midjourney that they are aware that the datasets for their generative AI model contains copyrighted material and that attribution is difficult due to the vast amount of data in the dataset. In the other, the CEO of Stability AI, Emad Mostaque, has gone on record in several interviews confirming that Stable Diffusion contains highly compressed data of the images used to train its database. These statements from the CEO of Stability directly refute a common claim from supporters of Stable Diffusion who claim that Stable Diffusion, as well as other generative AI image programs, do not contain the actual images in their training set. <br/>As artists, me and my colleagues have generally been some of the first to experiment with new technologies, including several older ones who were among the first artists to switch to digital drawing programs, none of us have been supportive of the current state of generative AI that uses the copyright work of artists without their permission in a manner that directly threatens our livelihoods as artists. We acknowledge that this technology will be here to stay for years to come, but we are at a pivotal moment in time where we must do everything we can to ensure that generative AI is trained ethically and with respect to copyright law, and the hard work of artists everywhere. We believe that these models should have allow artists opt-out their copyrighted works from training sets, and that for all future training, AI companies must receive direct permission to use their art for training, much like how other companies must gain permission from artists to use their art for purposes such as advertising, concept planning, etc.<br/>While generative AI can be a potentially powerful tool for artists in the future, we must ensure that all future development of generative AI models is done in a manner that is ethical and mutually beneficial for both developers and artists alike. By taking measures to ensure that models are trained only on data from the public domain and artists who have sold or given the rights to their work to companies, we stop the worst ethical issues with generative AI before they become too deep-rooted.

"Hello and thank you for the opportunity to comment on this emerging field of generative A.I. It is my opinion that the prompted output or result of image generating A.I. models such as those produced by DALLe, for example, should grant copyrights to the human user who created the string of words that served as a prompt or seed value for the image, which would otherwise not exist. The prompt itself is a creative and unique encoding of language which the A.I. relies upon in order to generate a correspondingly unique image. The DALLe and generative A.I. models in general serve as the brush, or the paint, and the canvase, but the art is created by the human user&#39;s creative and unique linguistic input. I have attached an image generated by DALLe based on my input to demonstrate this work. Thank you for your consideration.",[],Comment from Anonymous,2023-12-07T05:00:00Z
